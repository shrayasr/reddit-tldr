### Motivation

A personal project to learn `web.py` and `python` and the `praw` API

### Dependencies

- [web.py](http://webpy.org/)
- [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)

### How to use

Once you've cloned the project, go to the directory and run `python server.py` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/static/index.html` 

### wtf? 

This will not be a hosted webapp, probably. I just made this so i could learn (_see, Motivation_)

### Excite me

Heres how it looks
